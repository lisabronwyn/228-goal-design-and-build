# Goal Design & Build

## Challenge Rubric

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Have worked on 15+ goals at Learners Guild
- Are highly motivated to set up/fine tune your web presence


## Description

Are you in need of your own website? Are you getting serious about job hunting and working on your brand?

In this goal, you will:

- Carefully think of a relevant domain name for your professional career / "brand" 
- Do research into the pros and cons of using particular hosting companies
- Register your chosen domain with your carefully chosen hosting company
- Set up a personal mail server for your domain
- Deploy your site to Heroku ?

This is a great goal to choose if you've never registered your own domain, haven't set up mail servers through a hosting company, etc.

Note that this goal is a _solo_ goal (team size 1), so you will be working alone. You will need more self-direction to get this goal to completion as there is slightly less structure than other goals. That being said, please do use the resources available to you to get frequent feedback and guidance: other learners, coaches, and the goal librarian.

Review the specifications for more details on what is required.

## Context

Registering your own domain and dreaming up your personal brand for your new career as a software/web developer isn't something to be taken lightly. A lot of thought should go into your professional presentation and reputation online.

It is also a rewarding experience that will help you achieve many "a-ha" moments. Nothing says "I'm on the ball" more than having your own domain and especially your own me@me.com or info@richsoftwaredeveloper.com email address to give out and place on all of your promotional materials like your resume and/or business cards, etc.

As you go through this goal, you'll have to consider questions such as:

- What am I trying to achieve with my online presence?
- If my personal name is unavailable as a top-level domain (.com), what is a good alternative?
- Will I need a blog and am I interested in potentially using a CMS (content management system) like WordPress, etc.?
