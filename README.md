# Journey To Setting Up An Amazing Website!!

A deep dive into what it takes to register a domain, acquire hosting for your site/brand, implement a blog, and more.

Learn all about FTP, SMTP, etc.

You'll learn about the pros and cons of using paid or free services and implement one (or both!)

By reading articles, watching videos, completing lessons and exercises, you'll implement a final project at the end of the week.

## Your Domain

Your objective is to carefully choose a domain (paid) or subdomain (free).

### Domains and Your Personal Brand

Read articles about selecting a domain (paid) or subdomain (free) and building your personal brand:

### Domain Registrars and Hosting Companies

A domain registrar will not necessarily be your hosting company, if you're going the paid route.

One important consideration when you register your domain is whether you will also opt for private domain registration.

I've personally used the private option due to privacy and spamming concerns. This costs anywhere from an additional $9.99-$15.99 per year, and can be bundled with your domain name and/or hosting package for one stop shopping.

- https://www.networksolutions.com/domain-name-registration/private.jsp

Usually bundling all three will yield you a better price, but not always.

Google Domains provides the private service for free (currently with each domain registration)

#### FREE vs. PAID WEB HOSTING

There are many limitations that come with free web hosting. It's worth it to try doing this at least once, so that you can experience the limitations for yourself and also debug everything during the process.

PROS: free, lots of debugging, not much else.

CONS: advertising(!), subdomain doesn't allow for yourownpersonalsite.com and you'll end up with something like your-personal-site.freewebhosting101.com, very limited bandwidth, doesn't migrate very well.

FREE WEB HOSTING

- https://www.wix.com/
- https://www.000webhost.com/
- https://x10hosting.com/
- https://www.5gbfree.com/
- https://www.weebly.com/features/free-web-hosting
- https://www.one.com/en/ (this one provides 25 gigs but is only free for one year)

I've personally used 000webhost and 10xhosting to set up dummy sites for clients.


#### Content Management Systems (CMS)

There are three main CMS' in the wild, although WordPress is the most common. It powers up to 27% of all websites in existence!

Open source, and with a robust community, I've been using it since 2008 and highly recommend it, especially for blogging.

- https://wordpress.com/start/free/design-type-with-store (free subdomain)
- http://www.wordpress.org (your own hosting)
- https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/why-use-wordpress-for-my-website/
- https://websitesetup.org/

If you have your own hosting, WordPress can be installed easily with one-click in your hosting panel.

A NOTE ABOUT BLOGGING: even though I've been using WordPress for a long time, I also maintain a blog on Medium. It's a wonderful platform to get your thoughts out there to an audience that's easier to acquire than DIY.

Register your name or brand on Medium ASAP!

Medium is also useful to driving traffic to your own site(s). Don't forget that you can also cross-post blog entries to both.

## Design

This goal is less focused on design than the portfolio goal for example, but design is still very important.

Whenever I'm in a pinch for ideas and am not using WordPress, I go to these sites for inspiration:

- http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates
