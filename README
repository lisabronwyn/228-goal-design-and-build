# Domains, Registrars, Hosting Companies, Mail Servers, and more!

A day-by-day structured deep dive into what it takes to register a domain, acquire hosting for your site/brand, implement a blog, and more. Learn all about FTP, SMTP, etc.

You'll learn about the pros and cons of using paid or free services and implement one (or both!)

By read articles, watching videos, completing lessons and exercises, you'll implement a final project at the end of the week.

## Day 1: Your Domain

Your objective for the day: carefully choose a domain (paid) or subdomain (free).

### Domains and Your Personal Brand

- [ ] Read articles about selecting a domain (paid) or subdomain (free) and building your personal brand:
- https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2016/06/how-to-choose-the-right-domain-name/
- https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-seriously-comprehensive-guide-to-choosing-a-web-host--cms-25430


### Domain Registrars and Hosting Companies

A domain registrar will not necessarily be your hosting company, if you're going the paid route.

One important consideration for paying to register your domain is whether you will opt for Private Domain Registration.

I've personally used the private option due to privacy and spamming concerns. This costs anywhere from an additional $9.99-$15.99 per year, and can be bundled with your domain name and/or hosting package for one stop shopping.

- https://www.networksolutions.com/domain-name-registration/private.jsp

Usually bundling all three will yield you a better price, but not always. Google Domains provides this service for free (currently with each domain registration)

#### Content Management Systems (CMS)

There are three main CMS' in the wild, although WordPress is the most common. It powers up to 27% of all websites in existence!

Open source, and with a robust community, I've been using it since 2008 and highly recommend it, especially for blogging.

- http://www.wordpress.org (your own hosting)

If you have your own hosting, WordPress can be installed easily with one-click in your hosting panel.
